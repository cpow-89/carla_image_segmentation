# Image segmentation using Carla and Fast Ai


This repository shows you how to create your own image segmentation dataset by using the [Carla Simulator](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla). 
You can find full documentation and the code I used on in the 
[How to create your own image segmentation dataset](https://github.com/cpow-89/carla_image_segmentation) notebook.

This repository also shows you how to train a UNet Model for the image segmentation task by using the fast ai library. 
You can find the code in the 
[Train UNet for image segmentation Task](https://github.com/cpow-89/carla_image_segmentation) notebook.
